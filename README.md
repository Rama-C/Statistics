# Statistics

##Descriptive and inferential statistics

Project Overview

Statistics is a major component of data analysis, it allows us to investigate data and make inferences based on our observations. A foundation in statistics also allows us to be a consumer of analyses that others perform, and allows us to relate to the conclusions others have drawn from their investigations.

In this project, we will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. We will learn a little bit about the experiment, create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task, then go through the task yourself. We will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, we will interpret our results in terms of your hypotheses.

In a Stroop task, participants are presented with a list of words, with each word displayed in a color of ink. The participantâ€™s task is to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed. The task has two conditions: a congruent words condition, and an incongruent words condition. In the congruent words condition, the words being displayed are color words whose names match the colors in which they are printed: for example RED, BLUE. In the incongruent words condition, the words displayed are color words whose names do not match the colors in which they are printed: for example PURPLE, ORANGE. In each case, we measure the time it takes to name the ink colors in equally-sized lists. Each participant will go through and record a time from each condition.


This project helped me to implement
- How to identify components of an experiment
- How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample
- How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results
